Project Description:
General Description:
The user will select a sequence of three penny values. The program will then select its
sequence of three. The program will then produce penny values until one of the two
sequences shows up. The owner of whichever sequence (user or program) shows up
wins the round. There will be ten rounds. In the end, the program will tally how many
rounds the user won versus the program. If mistrust of the program is prevalent, an
option will be provided for the user to flip their penny to enter the values manually.
An option will be available toward the start of the program to see more information
regarding the mathematics behind the game. A visually aided and text-based
explanation will be provided to explain the processes of the game in a casual,
understandable manner.
Audio / Visual Design:
Some form of graphical representation will be utilized for the pennies as well as a
background gameboard. Animations will more than likely not be utilized. However,
sound effects and music will be added for increased entertainment.
Mathematics/Technical Explanation:
This project revolves around the function of selecting three sequential penny values.
These segmented sequences are to be used in conjunction with the program, randomly
producing coin values in a larger, potentially never-ending sequence.
While this larger sequence is producing values, the program will stop the production of
sequences if it locates an aforementioned segmented sequence of three. About the
segmented sequences, two will be utilized throughout the game. The user will select
one, then the program will select one relative to the segmented sequence selected by
the user.
The segmented sequence selected by the program will be specifically selected so that it
is statistically more probable to show up in the overarching sequence. It will take the
middle value of the user’s sequence, “flip” the value, and move that value to the front of
its segmented sequence.
Statistically speaking, the program sequence will occur more often due to the user
sequence generally relying on a portion of the program sequence to occur before the
user sequence can occur. It is not guaranteed to happen before the user’s sequence,
but it is more likely.
Platform:
Our tentative target platform is Windows 10. We will predominantly target the resolution
of 1920 by 1080p. However, we will attempt to support multiple resolutions. We have no
plans to make the program architecture-specific, but we will test the program on multiple
types of architecture to ensure portability between Windows 10 machines. If
inconsistencies are found, we will denote them for end-user convenience.
User Interface -
The primary user interface that the user will encounter will be that of the main menu. On
this menu, the user will be met with a few options. They can either play the game in its
original fashion (the program will “flip” the coin), they can play manually (the user flips
the coin), they can select an option to learn more about the math/technical aspects of
the game, or they can terminate the program. All of these options will have a casual
description next to each option. Each option will feature a UI that is tailored to that
specific option.
Video Inspiration -
The video that inspired us to build this program was “Penney's Game - Numberphile” by
the Numberphile YouTube channel. The URL for this video is below:

Program Interest -
The program will utilize graphics and audio to enhance the entertainment factor. When
describing any technical/mathematical terminology, a conversational tone will be used to
lower the chance of the user losing interest in the program
